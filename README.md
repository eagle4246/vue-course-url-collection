# Vue.js Course | URL Collection Tool

This is the first homework assignment for the course. The aim of the course is to create an URL collection tool. 

By default, the `Add` button is disabled. Once the user begins keying in a URL, the `Add` button will be activated. 

Users can have the option to add a `Title` to the URL. Checking the box, `Add Title` will allow the users to input a title of their choice. If `Add Title` is enabled but no title is given, the `Add` button will also be disabled. 

Users can choose to click the `Add` button with the mouse, or they can use the keyboard `Enter` key. 

If `Add Title` is checked, after inputing an URL and pressing `Enter`, the text box will focus on the `Enter Title` input box. 

If an invalid URL is given, the collection tool will store the option, however, the title will default to `Untitled`

Once an URL can be added, the `Enter URL` textbox will be focused, allowing users to quickly key in subsequent URLs. 

On the top right of the page, the option to change language is also available. Current Languages supports are only Chinese and English. 

Enjoy the URL Collection Tool!!
